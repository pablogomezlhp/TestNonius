# THE MOVIE DB - API
Let's search your favorite movie!
https://pablogomezlhp.github.io/TestNonius/

This API site was set up which focuses on interactivity with Javascript (DOM) and jQuery, plus HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap 4. Enjoy!
## UX
The idea was to create a simple and easily accessible page. For this it was necessary to initially design for mobile devices so that we can discard what was not really necessary.

## User Stories
As a user of this site, I would like to see details regarding the release year, company responsible for the production of the movie and also access to the movie site if possible. So the best way was to have all access only on one page, with a clear view and easy to understand. In the search field I chose to list all movies according to the input entered, so it is not necessary to know the correct / full name of the movie. I chose to create a clean and easily accessible website.

## Features
### Existing features
The home page features archiving data through local storage, so the latest search is saved and made available without the customer having to type again. It also has an alert that tells you if there are data that relate to the text you entered.
After the movie is selected the site loads a new page that shows the original title of the movie, shows the duration, the company responsible for the production of the movie. It shows a brief introduction to the history of the movie and also has an icon that leads to the IMDB website.
The page also provides an official website of the company responsible for the production of the film.
